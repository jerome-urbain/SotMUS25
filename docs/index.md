Welcome to the "How to put an entire count(r)y in a container: transportable OSM data integration into Postgis" hands-on session!


We will explore the seamless integration of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data in PostGIS using the Imposm tool within a Dockerized environment. The workshop is structured to guide you through the entire process:

-  Peparing your setup to learn Docker basics, 
- Setting up a PostGIS database, 
- Understanding Imposm's functionalities including 
    - the mapping between OSM keywords and Postgresql table attributes 
    - the command to load medium to big OSM datasets into Postgis
    - how to build a docker stack combining imposm and postgis
- Interacting with the loaded OSM data with QGIS and SQL,
- Enhancing your Docker stack for improved performance. 

Whether you're a GIS enthusiast, developer, or data professional, this workshop provides a practical and comprehensive approach to harnessing the synergy between OSM, PostGIS, and Docker.
