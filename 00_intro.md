Welcome to the "How to put an entire country in a container: transportable OpenStreetMap data integration into Postgis using docker" hands-on session!


We will explore the seamless integration of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data in PostGIS using the Imposm tool within a Dockerized environment. The workshop is structured to guide you through the entire process, starting from preparing your setup to learn Docker basics, setting up a PostGIS database, understanding Imposm's functionalities including the mapping between OSM keywords and Postgresql table attributes and the command to load medium to big OSM datasets, interacting with the loaded OSM data with QGIS and SQL, and even enhancing your Docker stack for improved performance. Whether you're a GIS enthusiast, developer, or data professional, this workshop provides a practical and comprehensive approach to harnessing the synergy between OSM, PostGIS, and Docker.
